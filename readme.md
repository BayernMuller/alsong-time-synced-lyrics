53.54s		 There's a lady who's sure all that
57.83s		 glitters is gold
59.99s		 And she's buying a stairway to heaven.
66.84s		 When she gets there
68.53s		 She knows If the stores are all closed
73.24s		 with a word
74.41s		 she can get what she came for.
81.6s		 Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway
89.98s		 to heaven.
93.59s		 There's a sign on the wall but she wants
98.01s		 to be sure
99.93s		 'Cause you know sometimes words
102.89s		 have two meanings.
107.05s		 In a tree by the brook there's a songbird
111.77s		 who sings,
113.54s		 Sometimes all of our thoughts are
116.92s		 misgiven.
139.53s		 Ooh, it makes me wonder,
147.7s		 Ooh, it makes me wonder.
159.05s		 There's a feeling I get when I look to
163.81s		 the west,
164.8s		 And my spirit is crying for leaving.
171.47s		 In my thoughts I have seen rings of
174.69s		 smoke through the trees,
177.12s		 And the voices of those who standing
181.28s		 looking.
189.29s		 Ooh, it makes me wonder,
199.69s		 Ooh, it really makes me wonder.
210.02s		 And it's whispered that soon If we all
214.19s		 call the tune
215.77s		 Then the piper will lead us to reason
221.76s		 And a new day will dawn for those
225.44s		 who stand long
227.46s		 And the forests will echo with laughter.
260.6s		 If there's a bustle in your hedgerow
264.53s		 don't be alarmed now,
266.1s		 It's just a spring clean for
268.29s		 the May queen.
271.65s		 Yes, there are two paths you can
274.16s		 go by
275.37s		 But in the long run
277.51s		 There's still time to change the road
280.36s		 you're on.
290.24s		 And it makes me wonder.
308.08s		 Your head is humming and it won't go
311.46s		 In case you don't know,
313.39s		 The piper's calling you to join him,
318.91s		 Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow,
322.84s		 And did you know your stairway lies
326.64s		 on the whispering wind
405.21s		 And as we wind on down the road
409.96s		 Our shadows taller than our soul.
414.65s		 There walks a lady we all know
419.51s		 Who shines white light
420.89s		 And wants to show how everything
424.97s		 still turns to gold.
428.74s		 And if you listen very hard
433.56s		 The tune will come to you at last
438.15s		 When all are one and one is all
442.54s		 To be a rock and not to roll.
467.07s		 And she's buying a stairway to heaven.
